    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The GTEx gene expression dataset consists of samples taken from many human subjects across a variety of tissues. From this dataset we have identified a set of highly-expressed tissue-specific genes. In this exercise, you will be pulling the expressing data for those genes but only in their primary tissue of expression and investigating how much variability exists across the sample population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Biological Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use metadata to associate data with subject or sample traits\n",
    "- Use descriptive statistics to make inferences about gene expression heterogeneity\n",

    "- Create and modify a dicitionary\n",

    "\n",
    "# Part 2\n",
    "No, the genes for a given tissue is highly variable. For example, the liver, although it has a low sample size, has different level of variability with one of the expression levels for the sample at ~0.05 while the other liver sample has an expression level at ~0.29. On the other hand, the testies and pancreas are tissues that seem to have the same level of relative variability at ~ 0.10 and ~0.04, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Part 3\n",
    "A possible reason for the difference in relative variability seen in the tissue might be due to the rate of cell regeneration or specific enzymes that encode for digestion. For example, it seems that the relative variability for the stomach and salivary gland are high which are correlated to digestion. In a similar vein, these cells regnerate at a higher rate than the ograns listed with a lower variability. Therefore, there may be these two possible reasons for the results seen.\n",

    "# Part 4\n",
    "I am surprised by the low variability in the pancreas given how important its role is in glucose uptake and dyresgulation correlating with type I diabetes."
