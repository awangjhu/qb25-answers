At chr VII 782842 and 788685, the three genes that have over 20 reads are ENP2, RPL24B, and NAT2. For ENP2, it is an active gene where most of the reads are at the end; similarly, NAT2 has most reads at the end of transcription and RPL24B has high coverage throughout the entire gene (presumably because it is a small gene).
